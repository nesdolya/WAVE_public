## Public scripts and results for the WAVE Project
Scripts and results that can be made available will be posted here by the end of 2021.

The WAVE Project's goals are to understand whale-watching activities using Automatic Identification System (AIS), and to determine the feasibility of utilizing AIS data as a tool for informing whale-watching operations, vessel traffic management, conservation, and policy.
